# abandonedArt
A collection of Generative Art I created, organized weekly. Inspired from Matt Pearson's 100 Abandoned Artworks, I will create at least one generative artwork every week. Perhaps I will add a UI for it at a later date.

The generative algorithms are written in P5.js, which is JavaScript library built with ideas and concepts taken from Processing. To view any artwork, just donwload the corresponding HTML and JS file. You will need the three P5.js files for the generative art to work.
